# Introduction

To execute this application, run:

`npm install`
`npm run electron:local`

## Missing features

### Audio input

At the moment, it is not possible to switch microphone

### Customizable graphics

At the moment only available graphic is a scoreboard having a timer. The idea is to extend it considering different sports needs (i.e. sets counter for volleyball or tennis). It will be also possible to customize appearance and colors

### Custom messages

There will be the possibility to show custom messages on video, with a style compliant to the graphic theme.
